# Objective 
In this project, we successfully analyze food hygiene ratings data using MongoDB. The data is extracted from the UK Food Standards Agency, and we must import, update and query the data to provide insights on the different locations. The different technologies used are MongoDB for NoSQL data operations, PyMongo for database queries, and Pandas for data manipulation. Within the Jupyter notebook, you can find detailed explanations on the hygiene ratings and the different establishments, and these conclusions are drawn from the results of our data analytics.
